      "reason": "The plan steps are not clear and specific, as they use vague terms like 'skim the question' and 'draft a concise answer'. Additionally, the steps do not directly address the question, instead providing general guidelines for writing an answer. The plan also lacks coverage of necessary aspects, such as considering the audience or purpose of the response.",

      "score": 0.9,
      "reason": "The response directly answers the question, is easy to understand, covers key points, and provides concrete examples or facts. The explanation of TLS protocol and its use of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography demonstrates a strong understanding of HTTPS encryption. However, the takeaway statement could be more concise.",

      "reason": "The response directly answers the question, provides easy-to-understand explanations of key concepts like TLS handshakes and symmetric/asymmetric cryptography. It also covers important points about HTTPS encryption's purpose and mechanism. However, it could be improved by including more concrete examples or facts to further illustrate its points.",
